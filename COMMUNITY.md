# Let's build yazi.nvim together

Hi, I'm Mika, and this is yazi.nvim 👋🏻

Super happy to see you here!

I started this project because I think it's fun to build cool things, and also
to learn how to build a neovim plugin. I have been very happy to see that many
people have found this useful.

This document lists some ways you can contribute to this project.

## Please share your ideas and feedback

There are many different kinds of people using this. I have been programming
professionally for a long time, and this is something I use in my work. I just
had someone reach out and tell me they use this for writing.

I want to encourage you to share your ideas and feedback:

- to report issues and request features, please use
  [issues](https://github.com/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim/issues). For example:
  - can't get something to work?
  - have an idea for a new feature?
  - want to help out with something?
- to ask questions, share ideas and feedback, please use
  [discussions](https://github.com/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim/discussions). For
  example:
  - have something cool that sparks joy? Please share!
  - give feedback on upcoming features and development ideas
  - tip: you can use the GitHub `watch` feature to get notified about new
    discussions and comments.

## Provide feedback on upcoming features

Generally, all new features will be opened as pull requests on GitHub. If you
want to provide feedback on upcoming features, you can

- follow new pull requests on GitHub (e.g. set
  `watch -> custom -> pull requests`)
- similarly, follow issues

To test pull requests locally, you can use `branch = "feature-branch-name"` in
your lazy.nvim plugin spec. See the lazy.nvim documentation for more
information: <https://lazy.folke.io/spec#spec-versioning>.
