Yazi is a blazing fast file manager for the terminal. This plugin allows you to
open yazi in a floating window in Neovim.

<https://github.com/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim/assets/300791/c7ff98ee-54d6-4ad0-9318-903e4b674f84>

## ‚ú® Features

- Open yazi in a floating window
- Files can be selected in yazi and opened in the current buffer, a vertical
  split, a horizontal split, or a new tab
- If multiple files are selected, they can be sent to the quickfix list
- (optionally) open yazi instead of netrw for directories
- Files that are renamed, moved, or deleted in yazi are kept in sync with open
  buffers in Neovim
  - The files are also kept in sync with currently running LSP servers
- Customizable keybindings
- üÜï Plugin manager for Yazi plugins and flavors
  ([documentation](./documentation/plugin-manager.md)). Please provide your
  feedback!

For previewing images with yazi, see Yazi's documentation related to Neovim
[here](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/image-preview/#neovim).

## üì¶ Installation

First, make sure you have the requirements:

- Neovim 0.10.x or later
- yazi [0.2.5](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/releases/tag/v0.2.5) or later
  - If you want to opt in to using the latest version of yazi, see
    [here](./documentation/installing-yazi-from-source.md) for how to install it
    from source

> [!TIP]
>
> You can run `:checkhealth yazi` to see if compatible versions are installed
> and working.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Using [lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/):

```lua
---@type LazySpec
{
  "mikavilpas/yazi.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  keys = {
    -- üëá in this section, choose your own keymappings!
    {
      "<leader>-",
      function()
        require("yazi").yazi()
      end,
      desc = "Open the file manager",
    },
    {
      -- Open in the current working directory
      "<leader>cw",
      function()
        require("yazi").yazi(nil, vim.fn.getcwd())
      end,
      desc = "Open the file manager in nvim's working directory" ,
    },
    {
      '<c-up>',
      function()
        -- NOTE: requires a version of yazi that includes
        -- https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/1305 from 2024-07-18
        require('yazi').toggle()
      end,
      desc = "Resume the last yazi session",
    },
  },
  ---@type YaziConfig
  opts = {
    -- if you want to open yazi instead of netrw, see below for more info
    open_for_directories = false,

    -- enable these if you are using the latest version of yazi
    -- use_ya_for_events_reading = true,
    -- use_yazi_client_id_flag = true,
  },
}
```

If you are not using lazy.nvim, see [lazy.lua](./lazy.lua) for what dependencies
are required.

### ‚öôÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è Advanced configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> You don't have to set any of these options. The defaults are fine for most
> users.
>
> For advanced configuration, it's recommended to have your Lua language server
> set up so that you can type check your configuration and avoid errors.
>
> For help on how to do this, there is a section for Neovim development tools in
> the [documentation](./documentation/for-developers/developing.md).

You can optionally configure yazi.nvim by setting any of the options below.

```lua
{
  -- ... other lazy.nvim configuration from above

  ---@type YaziConfig
  opts = {
    -- Below is the default configuration. It is optional to set these values.
    -- You can customize the configuration for each yazi call by passing it to
    -- yazi() explicitly

    -- enable this if you want to open yazi instead of netrw.
    -- Note that if you enable this, you need to call yazi.setup() to
    -- initialize the plugin. lazy.nvim does this for you in certain cases.
    --
    -- If you are also using neotree, you may prefer not to bring it up when
    -- opening a directory:
    -- {
    --   "nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim",
    --   opts = {
    --     filesystem = {
    --       hijack_netrw_behavior = "disabled",
    --     },
    --   },
    -- }
    open_for_directories = false,

    -- an upcoming optional feature. See
    -- https://github.com/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim/pull/152
    use_ya_for_events_reading = false,

    -- an upcoming optional feature
    use_yazi_client_id_flag = false,

    -- an upcoming optional feature. See
    -- https://github.com/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim/pull/180
    highlight_groups = {
      -- NOTE: this only works if `use_ya_for_events_reading` is enabled, etc.
      hovered_buffer = nil,
    },

    -- the floating window scaling factor. 1 means 100%, 0.9 means 90%, etc.
    floating_window_scaling_factor = 0.9,

    -- the transparency of the yazi floating window (0-100). See :h winblend
    yazi_floating_window_winblend = 0,

    -- the log level to use. Off by default, but can be used to diagnose
    -- issues. You can find the location of the log file by running
    -- `:checkhealth yazi` in Neovim. Also check out the "reproducing issues"
    -- section below
    log_level = vim.log.levels.OFF,

    -- what Neovim should do a when a file was opened (selected) in yazi.
    -- Defaults to simply opening the file.
    open_file_function = function(chosen_file, config) end,

    -- completely override the keymappings for yazi. This function will be
    -- called in the context of the yazi terminal buffer.
    set_keymappings_function = function(yazi_buffer_id, config) end,

    -- the type of border to use for the floating window. Can be many values,
    -- including 'none', 'rounded', 'single', 'double', 'shadow', etc. For
    -- more information, see :h nvim_open_win
    yazi_floating_window_border = 'rounded',

    hooks = {
      -- if you want to execute a custom action when yazi has been opened,
      -- you can define it here.
      yazi_opened = function(preselected_path, yazi_buffer_id, config)
        -- you can optionally modify the config for this specific yazi
        -- invocation if you want to customize the behaviour
      end,

      -- when yazi was successfully closed
      yazi_closed_successfully = function(chosen_file, config) end,

      -- when yazi opened multiple files. The default is to send them to the
      -- quickfix list, but if you want to change that, you can define it here
      yazi_opened_multiple_files = function(chosen_files, config, state) end,
    },

    integrations = {
      --- What should be done when the user wants to grep in a directory
      ---@param directory string
      grep_in_directory = function(directory)
        -- the default implementation uses telescope if available, otherwise nothing
      end,
    },
  },
}
```

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keybindings

These are the default keybindings that are available when yazi is open:

- `<c-v>`: open the selected file in a vertical split
- `<c-x>`: open the selected file in a horizontal split
- `<c-t>`: open the selected file in a new tab
- `<c-s>`: close the current yazi directory using
  [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)'s `live_grep`.
  If telescope is not available, nothing happens. You can customize the search
  action in your configuration.

Notice that these are also the defaults for telescope.

## ü™õ Customizing yazi

Yazi is highly customizable. It features its own plugin and event system,
themes, and keybindings. This section lists some of the plugins and themes that
I like.

- <https://gitee.com/DreamMaoMao/keyjump.yazi.git> allows jumping to a line by
  typing a hint character, much like
  [hop.nvim](https://github.com/smoka7/hop.nvim)
- <https://github.com/Rolv-Apneseth/starship.yazi> is a port of the
  [starship prompt](https://starship.rs) to yazi. It allows reusing the prompt
  you are using in your shell in yazi.
- <https://github.com/catppuccin/yazi> ports the catppuccin theme to yazi.
- <https://github.com/catppuccin/bat> can be used to change the syntax
  highlighting theme yazi uses to preview files. See
  [this discussion](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/discussions/818) or
  [my config](https://github.com/mikavilpas/dotfiles/commit/bb07515f69d219fd3435d222fcb2d80d27a25025#diff-973b37f40e024ca0f7e62f2569efce24ad550d0352adc8449168ac950af9eaf5R8)
  for an example of using it
